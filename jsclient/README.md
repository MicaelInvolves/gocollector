# JS Collector lib

## Scripts

* `yarn install` or `npm install`
* `yarn build` or `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under `lib` and `gocollector\static` folders
* `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `yarn test` or `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `yarn test:watch` or `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode
